# Observability (Monte Carlo / Ataccama)

- **Monte Carlo**: Monitor freshness/volume/schema of RAW/STAGING/SILVER; ingest dbt lineage for end-to-end views; alert to Teams.
- **Ataccama**: Register data products and rules; compute domain-level quality scores (e.g., USUBJID completeness, AE codelists).
